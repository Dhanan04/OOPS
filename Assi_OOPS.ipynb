    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of the object and restricts access to the data only through well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object to the outside world. It allows users to interact with objects without needing to know how they are implemented internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. It promotes code reusability and allows the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to behave differently based on the object they are called on, leading to code flexibility and modularity."
